    var ANSWER *ListNode   // define new blank LL
    
    for head != nil {  // LOOP THROUGH EACH POINTER BEGGING AT HEAD IE THE START
        ANSWER = &ListNode{Val: head.Val, Next: ANSWER}  // THIS LINE HAS TO BE MEMORIZED. THERE IS NO EASIER SOLUTION
                                                         // FILL UP THE STRUCT ANSWER NOW POINTS TO
                                                         // ANSWER IS REDEFINED LIKE a=a+1
