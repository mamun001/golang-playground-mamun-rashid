// 2769 Find the maximum achievable number

// Acceptance rate = 90.7%

// Had to get help for this one from youtube

// the wording of the problem is so overworked!

// basically x -t = num + t , solve for x , that's it!

func theMaximumAchievableX(num int, t int) int {

    // x -t = num + t
    // x = num + 2 *t

    return num + 2 * t
